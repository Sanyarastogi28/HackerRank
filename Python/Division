#Task
#The provided code stub reads two integers,a  and b, from STDIN.
#Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.
#No rounding or formatting is necessary.
#Example
#a=3
#b=5
#The result of the integer division 3//5 is 0.
#The result of the float division 3/5 is 0.6.

    c=a//b
    print(c)
    d=a/b
